## Installation

### Automatic installation
If you don't want to manually install, you can install this mod with the [Monke Mod Manager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager/releases/latest)

### Manual Installation

If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST! Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

This mod also depends on Newtonsoft.Json, so go to my latest [Newtonsoft.Json release](https://github.com/legoandmars/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/latest) and follow the instructions there.

It also depends on Utilla, so install the latest Utilla as well

Next, go to the latest release of this mod and extract it directly into your game's folder. Make sure it's extracted directly into your game's folder and not into a subfolder!

The mod is now installed!

If you'd like to install gorilla materials that people have made that don't come with the mod, drag the `.gmat` file into your `Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/Materials` folder.

If you'd like to install hats that people have made that don't come with the mod, drag the `.hat` file into your `Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/Hats` folder.

## Configuration

Gorilla Cosmetics currently comes with an in-game mirror that allows you to select your hat and material.

If you'd like to change one of the options not available ingame or manually change what cosmetics you have selected, you can edit the config found in `Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/config/GorillaCosmetics.cfg` (The game must be run *at least once* after installing the mod for this file to be generated)
